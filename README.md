## Bulk Importer

### Overview

Do you find yourself writing tons of boilerplate imports at the top of every
Scala file? I know I do. Masking stuff from Predef, enabling language features,
importing vital annotations like tailrec, it's all in a day's work.

This plugin aims to fix this by allowing the user to import a single alias
which is translated at compile time into all the desired imports.
